# GNU Econometrics Library (GEL)
Just a hobby project for me to learn some C. This project is just a WIP project where I am exploring how to do econometrics using C.

# But... noone is doing Econometrics in C year 2025
Correct — this is just me wanting to learn C as my experience in lower level languages is shallow.
