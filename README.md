# GNU Econometrics Library (GEL)
Just a hobby project for me to learn some C. This project is just a WIP project where I am exploring how to do econometrics using C.

# Ughh, but noone is doing Econometrics in C year 2025
Nope, they don't. In fact, programming is barely taught at all in Economics programs at all. Most people—at least in Sweden (to my experience)—uses STATA entirely through a GUI. As soon as something more complicated arises, the uni's start teaching R or Python. 

This is of course awesome because one can focus on the Econometrics and not memory allocation, but it also means that the code which is produced (at least on BSc & MSc level) is absolute garbage (mine as well), and is neither reproducible, and even worse, often incorrect because the algos used in the background is unknown to the users.

This is just me wanting to learn C, and since I have some experience in Econometrics I can focus less on the math and more on C.
