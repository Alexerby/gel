# GNU Econometrics Library (GEL)
Just a hobby project for me to learn some C. This project is just a WIP project where I am exploring how to do econometrics using C.

# Ughh, but noone is doing Econometrics in C year 2025
Nope, they don't. In fact, programming is barely taught at all in Economics programs at all.
This is just me wanting to learn C as my experience lower level programming is very shallow.

Maybe later on this can be expanded into a useful GUI (ㆆ _ ㆆ).
